US sanctions on China
The United States imposed a series of sanctions on China in 2020 over human rights concerns. The US imposed visa restrictions and sanctions on Chinese officials and businesses, citing repression of Uygurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Beijing's militarisation of its claims in the South China Sea. The US also sanctioned Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials deemed responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms. Beijing responded by banning a slew of US officials from entering China or doing business in China. US President Joe Biden's administration has signalled that human rights concerns will be a priority, and it could impose further sanctions on China.
